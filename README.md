This is my first challenge with tailwind CSS. This challenge is from frontend Mentor website. Link below: "https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/manage-landing-page-SLXqC6P5". 

There has been talks about how tailwind CSS make life easy as a developer and I decided to give it a try. At the end of the day I enjoyed it and hoping to use it in my future projects.
